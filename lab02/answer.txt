Question:
- If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build
a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?

Answer:
No! Since we can have many constructor in a class so that constructor method is a overlapping method. Therefore, each constructor much have different
signature. Because title and category has the same data type (String), so when we create a constructor method by title, so we can not create a constructor by category
since these two constructor will has the same signature is its name, the number of parameters is 1, and data type of its parameter is "String".
