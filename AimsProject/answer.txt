- If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?

The answer is no. Although we can create multiple constructors with the same name, but we can’t do it if the data type of parameters in these constructors are the same. In this case, “title” and “category” have the same initial data type: String.
